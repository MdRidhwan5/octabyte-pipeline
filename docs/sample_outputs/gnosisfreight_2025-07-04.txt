What is the Container Lifecycle ManagementÂ®Platform?
âMost vendors come in and pitch. Gnosis came in and listened.â
"Gnosis is our visibility partner of choice!"
My company has tested multiple container visibility tracking tools and we find Gnosis to be Best in Class. Gnosis predictive ETA's are accurate and trustworthy, allowing our team to execute with reliable data."
"The best container tracking platform by far"
Gnosis allows me to easily track my customers bookings, manage ETDs and ETAs, and track shipments. One of my favorite features of Gnosis Freight, is being able to set alerts for all of my customers.
"Gnosis eliminates all of my excel spreadsheets!"
I love the flexibility of the platform and how easy it is to modify to our needs. It doesn't take weeks to get a change made to a chart or KPI metric that we want included or removed, it is the same day.
"The CLM Platform helps us be more efficient!"
"The biggest saving is always overall inventory. Its binding capital aspect needs to be carefully managed. For all those inventory-related costs, Gnosis Freight definitely helps us be more efficient."
